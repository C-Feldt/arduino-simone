Title: Aruino Simone

Description: A remake of the game "Simon"! Using the Arduino, inputs are taken from an Elegoo Uno to play the game.

Purpose: To fulfill LSU's CSC2364 Final Integration Project requirements.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: This project was designed to function with an Arduino Elegoo
    The application is currently not compatible with keyboard
    This will have to be added in a future update
    (Since this is a class project, I doubt that'll happen.)
